For when you have a lot of documents and need to search them to get info, and then write a report. Which also happens to be an uncomfortably large percentage of all white collar jobs.

What it does
- Read and index information to pull from
    ○ Able to read powerpoint, pdf, url now
    ○ Clean the data
- Get the query and headings relevant for the report
    ○ Convert the query into questions
    ○ Extract relevant passages from the data
    ○ Use them and write the report
- TODO
    ○ Add agents to critically analyse the report and review/ rewrite
    ○ Check what information is still missing
    ○ Search Wikipedia/ Google etc to retrieve that info and incorporate it
